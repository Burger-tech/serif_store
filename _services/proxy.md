Our Proxy service is a web browser **inside of your own browser**

![FireFox Browser](/images/firefox_icon.webp)

# Purpose

There are many uses for a proxy; especialy one that you can use in your own browser.

1. The Proxy goes through a vpn, so that all of your data is encrypted and secure.
2. The Proxy will be gaurded by the authentication service that all NetRoot suite services use, so you only need one login, and nobody will get in to your services.
3. Our Proxies are kept well updated, so you can rest assured that everything will be working properly.

## Technical Things

 > All of the work we do on our Proxies has to be credited to Linuxserver.io, as they're the ones that made all of this possible with all of their amazing docker images. 
We are using docker for the updates and enviroment for all of our Proxies. The proxies themselves are all running in their own seperate (unpriveleged) virtual enviroments, so they are as secure as possible.


## Pricing

The pricing of our Proxies can depend on what kind of processing power and RAM you need to be at your most productive. Pricing goes as follows (per month):

| 1GB RAM  | 2GB RAM  | 4GB RAM  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| $5       | $9.99    | $15      |


### Enjoy!
